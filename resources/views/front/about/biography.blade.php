                            <p class="static-content-text mt16">Ching is an International Emmy nominated TV chef &
                                cookery author who has become an ambassador of Chinese cooking around the world.
                                Born in Taiwan, raised in South Africa and U.K., cookery was a vital connection
                                between Ching and her Chinese heritage.</p>
                            <p class="static-content-text">Ching's approach to cookery stems from the traditional
                                cooking and lifestyles of her farming community grandparents in Southern Taiwan, and
                                these are her major food influences.</p>
                            <img class="img-big img-wrap-text-right" src="{{ asset('/images/about/ching.jpg') }}" alt="Ching He Huang's Lotus Wok Set"/>
                            <p class="static-content-text">Her creative food ethos is to use fresh, organic and
                                ethically sourced ingredients to create modern dishes with Chinese heritage, fusing
                                tradition and innovation. Ching strives to bridge cultural understanding through
                                food, making Chinese cooking accessible, healthy and nutritious, appealing to both
                                the East and West.</p>
                            <p class="static-content-text">Ching has demonstrated she is the go-to expert for
                                Chinese cuisine. Her career in the media as a TV chef and author has spanned the
                                last decade, transforming people's perceptions of Chinese food over this time by
                                keeping it fresh, popular and engaged. She works tirelessly to promote Chinese
                                cuisine through her TV shows, books, wok range and involvement in many high profile
                                campaigns and causes.</p>
                            <p class="static-content-text">Ching's dynamic approach to modern Chinese food is
                                evident in her immensely popular TV work. Many of her shows are sold, distributed
